#   DCE - Discord Cache Exporter

Discord Cache Exporter is a simple tool that will copy the Discord Media cache files over to the specified folder, and give them their respective file extension.  
Discord Cache is usually found at %APPDATA%/discord/Cache, this program will attempt to find this directory automatically and then you will have to specify the output folder to where the files will be copied over.
